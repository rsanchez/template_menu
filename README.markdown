# Template Menu #

An accessory for easier access to templates.

## Installation

* Copy the /system/expressionengine/third_party/template_menu/ folder to your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ folder

## Always Open

I prefer to have this accessory open at all times, by default. To turn this behavior off, open the file and change the $always_open property to FALSE.
